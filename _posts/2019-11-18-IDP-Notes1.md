## The reason to do [IDP](myidp.sciencecareers.org)
- Create a plan now to move on after your training
- Improve productivity and satisfaction
- Increase confidence in post-trainig career goals
- Increase self-efficacy: Belief that you can achieve it 

## Self-assessment
You can found resources in [IDP](myidp.sciencecareers.org)
### Value Clarification Exercise / Disconnects Discussion
- What is one value that you ranked as most important?
- Based on your stated career from the beginning of this workshop, what is one values-based disconnect you will encounter in that career?
- What is one challenge you will face in this career path due to that value?
- What is one potential solution to that challenge? (Ask partner for another solution)

### Skills assessment
- What science career-related tasks am I good at doing?
- What tasks am I not good at doing?
- What tasks are important for success in my future career?
- How do I raise my skill level in important task areas?

### Skills vs Interests
- Remember to break a career path down to specific tasks.
- What common tasks involve skills you need to improve in order to be successful? (skill disconnect)
  - How can you improve? 
- What common tasks involve skills you are good at but not enjoy? (interest disconnect)
  - What's a potential solution? 

### IDP process
- Develop a finite sets of career paths
- Explore career options with focus on your SIV results.
- Narrow options through structured process of elimination

## Career exploration
MyIDP has a `My Career Path Match` after you did the Self-assessment. You can use this as a start. `Read about careers`
- Read about careers
  - LinkedIn
    - Search for Job Title that you are interested in
    - How long does one stay in industry research jobs before moving to leadership?
    - What transitional experience do I need?
- Attend career events
- **Talk to people**
  - Most helpful: talk to professional in the career path
  - Informational interviews
    - Deeper information on career choices
    - Appointment in advance
    - List of specific questions
    - Thank you notes
    - value questions
    - IDP website has a list
- Get experience
  - [InterSECT](https://students.wustl.edu/intersect-job-simulations/)
  - interview

### Assignment
- Invest time in career exploration reading
  - articles on careers of interest
  - LinkedIn searches
  - read 20-30 job postings of interest, identify themes
- Populate your LinkedIn PTO(People, Title, Organizations) list with at 6-10 people who are in the same career area as your Plan A or Plan B. Synthesize useful info by looking for themes:
  - Did they complete transitional training after PhD? If so, what?
  - What job titles tended to be in between PhD and current?
  - What organizations or groups are they following?
  - What skills or qualifications are you missing that they all have?

The next part would be set goals:
- PTO list/map
- Complete a list of skills development goals for next year
